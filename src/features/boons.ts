  `You dared ask Vassetri for a boon of power and a bite on the neck was your reward. It provides the following benefits:

  - You may cast the spell [speak with animals] at will, but it can only target snakes.
  - As a bonus action, you hiss threateningly at an enemy within 5 feet. If the enemy fails a Wisdom save, they must spend their reaction to move half of their speed away from you in any direction. The DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. You can only use this ability once per short or long rest, and only when you are able to speak.`
